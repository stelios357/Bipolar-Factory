# Bipolar-Factory
I first searched the net for various web pages for information on Indian Celebrites , Unfortunately there are only 2 i.e,. IMDB and Forbes . 
They both had a data base of 100 indian celebrities each . 
I crawled their website and gather their data in two seperate file Forbes.csv and imdb.csv (I have included the files for original data.) . 
Rest of it self explainatory or I ahve mentioned in comments in the notebook . 
It is a lot of hardwork and I am submitiing it 2 days before the dead line hope I get some brownie points for it . 
Thankyou . Enjoy .
Reach out to me for any doubts
